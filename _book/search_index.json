Design SprintThis repo is a collection of documents intended to help guide a design sprint.\nIt contains guidelines that should not be followed exactly.\nEach sprint should be tailored to the individual project.\nIt is written by and for the thoughtbot team.Previous Sprints\n\nPre-Sprint Preparation\n\nUnderstand Phase\n\nDiverge Phase\n\nConverge Phase\n\nPrototype Phase\n\nTest Phase\n\nWhat is a product design sprint?A product design sprint is a technique to\nquickly solve product design problems\nand test the viability of a solution.\nIt has been pioneered by the\nGoogle Ventures Design\nTeam.Why do a design sprint?A design sprint orients the team\nand aims our efforts toward a mutual goal.\nDesign thinking and product design sprints\nkeep us on target\nand invest our time and money wisely.Sprints are useful when kicking off a new\nbusiness, product, feature, or workflow.\nSprints can also be used to solve problems with an existing product.What should you expect to have at the end of a design sprint?At the end of the sprint,\nthe team will understand the problem and\nwill have validated\nwhether we have a viable solution to begin building\nor whether we need to run another sprint to keep searching for a solution.Design Sprint OverviewA design sprint is comprised of five phases;\nUnderstand, Diverge, Converge, Prototype and Test.\nEach phase typically lasts one day.Pre-SprintWe should not start a sprint\nwithout defining a \"job to be done\"\nas the focus of the sprint.\nThe \"job to be done\" may evolve during the sprint\ninto a problem statement agreed upon by the whole team,\nbut without one as a starting point\nour client is not ready and should not be paying us.Understand PhaseThe Understand phase\ndevelops a common understanding\nof the context within which we are working\nand all the elements in that context:\nthe customer,\ntheir job to be done,\nand the business our client hopes to support by servicing the job to be done.\nWe want to expose risky knowledge gaps and assumptions\nso we can make plans to reduce those risks\nand move forward with confidence.Diverge PhaseThe Diverge phase\ngenerates insights and concepts for solutions.\nOur goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible,\nregardless of how feasible or viable.\nInsights are born from this explosion of possibilities\nby considering the implications of\nradically different approaches to solving a problem.\nThese insights can become\nvaluable differentiating forces\nand the source of\ninspiration for unique solutions.Converge PhaseThe Converge phase\ntakes all the possibilities generated over the past two phases\nand hones in on a single version\nto prototype\nand test with existing or potential customers.\nBy exploring and eliminating so many options,\nwe have reason to be more confident in our choices.Prototype PhaseThe Prototype phase\ndevelops a prototype\nthat fills our riskiest knowledge gaps and assumptions.\nPaper prototypes,\nKeynote prototypes,\nFlinto prototypes,\nand\nstatic HTML/CSS pages\nare all valid mediums.\nThe medium\nshould be determined by\nour time constraints\nand learning goals.Test PhaseThe Test phase\ntests our prototype\nwith existing or potential customers.\nBy the end of this phase,\nwe should have validated or invalidated\nour riskiest knowledge gaps and assumptions\nand have confidence in our next steps.Design Sprint Trello TemplateThroughout the sprint you want to be recording as much as possible.\nWe've found Trello to be an excellent tool to help the team record the activities\ntaken during the sprint. This template helps alleviate some of the initial setup\nfor the board and leaves references to this repo.Copy this template\nto your own board to help guide and document your sprint.Example Design Sprint ScheduleSchedule for Understand\n\nSchedule for Diverge\n\nSchedule for Converge\n\nSchedule for Test\n\nFurther Readingthoughtbot's blog post\n\nthoughtbot playbook\n\nGoogle Ventures Design Staff blog postsBefore the sprint: Prepare\n\nDay 1: Understand\n\nDay 2: Diverge\n\nDay 3: Decide\n\nDay 4: Prototype\n\nDay 5: Validate\n\n\nIDEO's Human Centered Design Toolkit\nHow To Conduct Your Own Google Ventures Design Sprint\n\nPersonal Design Sprint\n\nGamestorming and the Gamestorming Wiki\n\nGood Kickoff Meetings\n\nContributingWe love new ideas that push this repository and design sprints forward.

Toward that end, we want to document sprints and identify success factors at each phase and the structuring of the overall sprint.Here is a living list of previous sprints. After running a design sprint, feel free to add a retrospective on your sprint using the example README.md – the PR process allows for other designer to review as well:======Example Project: Month, Year - Jony Ive"},"Previous-Sprints/Example-Month-Day-Year/":{"url":"Previous-Sprints/Example-Month-Day-Year/","title":"Example Project","keywords":"","body":"Client: Example Client\nOffice: Atlantis\nDesigner(s): Jony Ive\nDate: 8.21.84\nTrello Board: https://trello.com/\nContextThis is general context about the sprint, the project, and the client.

Guides the sprint from start to\ncompletion.Recorder Takes notes, photographs and is in charge of the documentation for\nthe sprint.Product Owner Typically the client and the person with the initial product vision. \nThis person has final say in the product.Set expectations for the outcome for the sprintSometimes, design sprints converge on solutions that are\npartially or completely invalidated.\nSome things will have worked, and others won't.\nMake sure everyone understands that the outcome\nfalls in one of three buckets:Most stuff worked\n\nThis often doesn't happen during the first sprint on a project,\nbut if it happens to you,\neveryone on the team is probably on the same page about the fixes and\ntweaks you need to make.What to do next: Take a week to tune your existing prototype. Create a backlog\nfor developers to start implementation of the most important features or API\nintegrations.Some big questions\n\nA common outcome after a user study is a mixed bag: a few hits, a few\ntweaks, and a couple of real head-scratchers. Fortunately Keynote prototypes are\neasy to change, and as long as some parts of your design are solid, you can\nprobably build on what you have.What to do next: You can move fast on the tweaks, but you’ll want to come up\nwith multiple solutions for the bigger problems. Start your next sprint at step\n2 (diverge).Everything exploded\n\nWe've seen a lot of designs go up in flames, and that's OK. You learned that\nsomething didn’t work, and it only took you a few hours to build it.\nThis is great progress, and very cheap relative to building \nand launching a full product.\nThink what would have happened if you’d spent weeks or\nmonths implementing this solution!What to do next: Start your next sprint back at the drawing board with step 1 (understand).

From here can make plans to fill the\nriskiest knowledge gaps and validate or invalidate our riskiest assumptions.Throughout Understand you should be working on defining the business, who is\ngoing to be using the product, how this product is solving a problem that those\nusers have. What are the situations that users will be using the product or\nfeature? What are their motivations behind using it? What are any outside\nmotivators that might effect their use? The whole team should think about what\nproduct success looks like and what success looks like for just the sprint.The team should also talk about what they don't know, where knowledge gaps are\nfor the problem. As all of those are being defined assumptions that. The team\nshould cover existing research done before the sprint and review analysis of\ncompetitive products.At the end of Understand the team should have captured the critical path for the\nproblem.A Guide for Understand:As you work through the understand phase of a sprint there will be a lot of\nquestions that come up and information that is uncovered.Ask obvious questions and embrace the beginners mind.Shoshin(初心) is a concept in Zen Buddhism meaning beginner's mind. It refers\nto having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when\nstudying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a\nbeginner in that subject would.Activities for Understand:Needs / Wants / DesiresStart with a feature wish list and condense into columns of priority for\n\"Needs\"(aka Must Haves, Top Priority), \"Wants\"(Nice to Haves), \"Desires\"Would\nlove to have someday...). This activity is great for ironing out which features\nare most important and which could potentially be put on the back burner list.Five WhysThis activity is meant to dig down deep into what the actual reasons are for a\nproblem or what the problem actually is. It is good to use when the apparent\nproblem seems to only be a symptom of a larger problem. It is based off of a\ngame found in\nGamestorming.Who / What / Where / WhenThis activity is meant to get consensus on what the problem that is trying to be\nsolved when the opinions are widely different. It gives everyone a chance to\nvoice they opinions on what. It is based off of a game found in\nGamestorming.Critical PathAs a group, use your common understanding to collaboratively map out the user\nstory that’s important in this sprint. The facilitator (or another volunteer)\nshould stand at the whiteboard and sketch the flow. This doesn’t have to be\nfancy to be useful.Start an Assumptions BoardThroughout the day and rest of the week we will ask questions we don’t have\nanswers to and identify assumptions we are relying on. We will capture these\n‘Assumptions’ on a board for later organization and analysis.Problem StatementIdentifying the problem will help to determine if there is a problem, if that\nproblem is solvable, and how to solve that problem. This step will be the first\nstep to answering this question: What is this product, and is it useful?Start a Back-burner BoardWe will also be generating a lot of ideas throughout the week. Some of the ideas\nwill be pertinent to the tasks at hand, but others, although interesting, won’t\nbe. We will capture these good but not immediately relevant ‘back-burner ideas’\non a sticky note board.Pitch PracticeThe product owner should walk the sprint team through the business opportunity\nand market. The repetition of this process throughout the design sprint helps to\nreinforce an understanding of the essential value of the product.Open Card SortingCard sorting helps categorize and prioritize features, ideas and different concepts so that it is easier to understand the problem.

From all of the discovery we have done over the past two days, we\nfeel strongly about differentiating ourselves in the market by capturing the\ncustomer with an emotional and inspirational AirBnb like venue discovery\nexperience.To test if we can successfully do this, we decided on a very image heavy\nlayout that suggests beautiful wedding themes and experiences to get the\npotential customer thinking aspirationally about their wedding experience.

The couple is filled with excitement; as the wedding day\nwill usher forth a new life for the couple together. However, the couple might\nexperience a bit of uncertainty as to how even to proceed planning their\nwedding. We want to capture couples at their “excitement” period and put aside\nall uncertainty and potential anxiety that the wedding planning process may\ncause. A customer’s initial engagement with our website should parallel his/her\nengagement with the wedding process in general.With our prototype, we want to evaluate our ability to capture the excitement of\na recently engaged person and leverage that excitement to create engagement with\nour website."},"5-Test/":{"url":"5-Test/","title":"Test Phase","keywords":"","body":"Test & Learn: Test the right pathReactions to competitive demos, our assumptions for the prototype, what we were\nlooking for and the reactions to the prototype.\nGoing into each test you should have a plan of what you are testing and how you\nknow if that is successful or not.

Though the dataset was limited due to the\nbackground and interest of those we interviewed, we gained some important\ninsight to help us build a superior wedding planning product. People’s\ncomplaints about competing wedding sites, such as The Knot, Wedding Wire, and\nOffbeat Bride, were about the lack of focus on those websites (too\ndisorganized, too much information). They were most engaged by browsing things\nlike wedding dresses, cakes  etc.While it is important for any newly engaged person to gain access to important\ninformation about the wedding planning process, some of these websites\nprovided stress and anxiety as much as they did excitement about the “Big\nDay.” Furthermore, while acknowledging that the first step in their processes\nmight be to contact friends and to think about location, these other websites\npresented an overwhelming wealth of information (such as on decoration and\nwear) that might be more informative later on in a couple’s wedding planning\nprocess after they have chosen the wedding location and venue.The primary assumption we were testing for with our prototype was that we will\nbe able to create an engaging, exciting an emotional experience that gets\npeople fantasizing about their wedding through images, storytelling and high\nquality information. We chose to test for this because we believe that if we\ncan engage and pull customers into the product in this way, we may be able to\nmore successfully introduce rational planning, communication tools, and\npremium services once they move further down the engagement funnel. Through\ncompetitive analysis we also identified this emotional/aspirational experience\nas a means of differentiation in the market.When shown the Great Engagements Prototype, the users were engaged with the\nmad-libs functionality and with the large, eye-catching images that create our\ndemo website (http://greatengagements.herokuapp.com/). They understood right\naway that the website is about venue discovery and their initial emotional\nreactions were that of excitement and inspiration, very much the reactions we\nwere looking for to validate our primary assumption. These results give us\nreason to further pursue our concepts of immersive, inspirational and\naspirational exploration of venues that would ultimately lead customers to\nrevenue-generating activities.”"},"Exercises/3-12-3.html":{"url":"Exercises/3-12-3.html","title":"3-12-3","keywords":"","body":"3 12 3Supplies needed: Easel Pad, Paper, SharpieEstimated time: 30 MinutesBest to use when3-12-3 is best to use for large groups of people that are looking to converge on\nto one single idea.
